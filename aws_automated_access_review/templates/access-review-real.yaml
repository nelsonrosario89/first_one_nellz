Description: 'AWS Access Review - Automated security posture assessment and reporting'

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# TEMPLATE PARAMETERS
# These are the inputs that can be customized during deployment
# ----------------------------------------------------------

Parameters:
  # Email where the security reports will be sent - this must be verified in SES
  RecipientEmail:
    Type: String
    Description: Email address to receive security reports
    
  # How often the security scan will run automatically
  # Examples: rate(1 day), rate(30 days), cron(0 12 * * ? *) for noon UTC daily
  ScheduleExpression:
    Type: String
    Default: 'rate(30 days)'
    Description: "Schedule expression for running the access review (default: monthly)"
    
  # The S3 bucket name to use - if left blank, CloudFormation will generate a unique name
  # This is useful when you want to specify a memorable name or reuse an existing bucket
  ReportBucketName:
    Type: String
    Default: ''
    Description: Name for the S3 bucket to store reports (leave blank for auto-generated name)

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# CONDITIONS
# Logical conditions that control resource creation behavior

Conditions:
  # This condition checks if we should create a bucket with auto-generated name
  # If ReportBucketName is empty, this evaluates to true
