## 💼 Professional Summary

### About You (2-3 paragraphs)

I’m Nelson Rosario, a cloud GRC engineer who turns ISO 27001 and SOC 2 requirements into AWS-native automation. I’ve built GitHub Actions + Python workflows that validate multi-region CloudTrail, tag EC2 scope, flag risky IAM principals, and publish evidence to S3—keeping audits continuous instead of annual fire drills.

My first_one_nellz toolkit shows how I wire boto3 scripts, GitHub OIDC roles, and guardrail checks into CI pipelines so findings surface in minutes. Currently completing AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) while expanding an S3 public-access detector and broader compliance labs. Let's connect if you need real-time assurance in the cloud.

**Your Summary:**  
```
Cloud GRC engineer delivering AWS-native control automation for ISO 27001 and SOC 2 programs. I pair GitHub Actions, boto3, and evidence pipelines so audits move at engineering speed.
